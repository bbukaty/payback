PHP actions:

get info stored in a table by name, return as either html table or javascript array for names (need to figure this out)
edit item in debts table (change quantity, edit text, or remove)
transfer row from debts to history

user page with all debts and owes (as negative debts?) 
automatically cancel out complementary bets

shift to a more feed-like style, no history, just included on main page 
 - multiple pages? stuff will pile up in that feed
 - search options
