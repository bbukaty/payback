# payback
This is a project I made for a summer internship in high school, in which I learned the basics of web development.  

My co-workers had a habit of placing bets for food on the outcomes of ping pong matches, so I made a little dashboard to keep track of who owed who what. It even had individual pages for each user in the system, which elevated its usefulness slightly beyond, you know, a whiteboard or something.  

Just don't worry about the database password stored in plaintext in the php script. Or the fact that all the DOM manipulation I do is in the form of adding plaintext to a bunch of elements' innerHTML attribute. Or the default bootstrap css...  

Looking at these old projects is a hoot.
